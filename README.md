# Testing Project with Jasmine

We used Jasmine to test this demo app. 

### Assets

- [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

### How to run
**Locally in your browser**
- Clone this repo to a directory of your choosing on your computer
- Open the directory where you downloaded the repo
- Double click on the `index.html` file to open in your default brower or right click to choose which browser you'd like the file to open
- Then scroll down to the bottom of the page to see "speces, failures"

**Locally with Node.js**
- Make sure you have Node.js installed
- Clone this repo to a directory of your choosing on your computer
- To quickly create a "server" on your machine, you'll want to install http-server
- Run `http-server` in the terminal inside the directory of your cloned repo
- Output in the terminal should indicate what addresses or IP's you can navigate to on your browser to view this page
